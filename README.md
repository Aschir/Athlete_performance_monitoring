# Athlete Performance Monitoring & Anomaly Detection for Doping Controls

## Case Study Seminar – MSc Data Science & Artificial Intelligence

This repository contains the work developed for a **Case Study Seminar** in the **MSc Data Science and Artificial Intelligence** at **Université Côte d’Azur**, in collaboration with the **Athletics Integrity Unit (AIU)**.

The project explores how **data science and machine learning** can be used to monitor athlete performance over time and to detect **unusual or atypical patterns** that may be relevant in the context of **anti-doping and integrity monitoring in elite athletics**.

## Why this project?

Athlete performance data carries valuable information beyond race results alone. When analyzed longitudinally, performance trends can reveal patterns that are difficult to spot with the naked eye — such as sudden improvements, irregular progressions, or deviations from expected behavior.

In this project, we investigate how **statistical analysis, time-series methods, and anomaly detection techniques** can support anti-doping efforts by:

- Tracking performance trajectories across seasons  
- Highlighting performances that deviate from typical patterns  
- Supporting experts with data-driven insights rather than automated decisions  

The goal is **not to accuse or label athletes**, but to provide **transparent and interpretable tools** that can assist existing doping control and integrity processes.

## What we focus on

The project covers several key components:

- Cleaning and structuring athlete performance data  
- Modeling performance evolution over time  
- Applying unsupervised and semi-supervised anomaly detection methods  
- Interpreting results in a sports integrity context  

Throughout the project, we pay close attention to **ethical considerations**, data privacy, and responsible use of AI.
